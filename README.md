# Custories

Custories is a web platform that allows users to create personalized illustrated storybooks
based on their own characters, styles, and themes, using AI-assisted generation and
print-on-demand fulfillment.

## Vision
Enable anyone to create a custom storybook by:
- uploading character images
- choosing a visual genre (anime, manga, cartoon, realistic, etc.)
- defining chapters and themes
- receiving a printed book at home

## Core Principles
- Scalable by design
- AI generation is asynchronous and resilient
- Credits-based pricing
- Chapter-level generation and recovery
- Minimal downtime
- Clear separation between web app, AI jobs, and external services

## Target Users
- Parents
- Gift buyers
- Story creators (non-technical)

## Project Status
Phase 0 – Foundations (planning & setup)

## Non-goals (for MVP)
- No subscriptions
- No mobile app
- No social features
